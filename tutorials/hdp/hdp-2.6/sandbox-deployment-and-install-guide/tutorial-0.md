# Sandbox Deployment and Install Guide

The Hortonworks Sandbox is delivered as a virtual machine.  A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is backed by the physical resources of a host.  Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security.
