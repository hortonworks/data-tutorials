# Superset in Trucking IoT on HDF

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover core concepts of Data Visualization and the role Superset plays in an environment in which clearly communicating the information about the data visually is important.

We will create data visualization slices to clearly communicate the insight found from large volumes of data that originated from the trucking dataset.

## Prerequisites

- [HDF Sandbox Installed](https://hortonworks.com/downloads/#sandbox)
- 10 GB RAM provided to HDF Sandbox, your local machine should have at least 3 - 6 GB RAM left to stay stable

## Outline

- **Superset in Trucking IoT Use Case** - Learn about the role Superset plays within the real-world use case and core concepts of Data Visualization
- **Visualize Trucking Data** - Create Superset Visualization slices to illustrate different visual data representations of the demo's trucking dataset
