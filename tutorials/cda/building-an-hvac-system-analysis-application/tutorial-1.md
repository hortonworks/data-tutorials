- [HVAC Data Analysis](#hvac-data-analysis)

### Sensor Data

A **sensor** is a device that measures a physical quantity and transforms it into a digital signal. Sensors are always on, capturing data at a low cost, and powering the **Internet of Things**.

### Use of Sensor Data

In the application development, we will focus on sensor data from building operations. Specifically, we will refine and analyze the data from **Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning** (HVAC) systems in 20 large buildings around the world.
