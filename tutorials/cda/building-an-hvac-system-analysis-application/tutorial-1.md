# Application Development Concepts

## Introduction

The objective for this lesson is to introduce you to some fundamental ideas of
an HVAC System, such as being able to answer what an HVAC System is, why it is
important and what are the goals the system is trying to accomplish. The next
objective is to learn about the sensors that are commonly used in HVAC Systems
and how you can analyze and visualize insight to the health of the HVAC System.
The appendix lists many of the common components that makeup the HVAC System.

## Prerequisites

- Read overview on Building an HVAC System Analysis Application

- [Summary](#summary)
- [Further Reading](#further-reading)
- [Appendix A: Components that make up an HVAC System](#appendix-a-components-that-make-up-an-hvac-system)

## HVAC System Analysis Fundamentals

### What is an HVAC System?

**HVAC** is a machine that handles the ***heating, ventilation and air
conditioning*** in a building.

### Why is the HVAC System important in Commercial Buildings?

**HVAC Systems** play a critical role in controlling the building's temperature,
providing fresh air circulation and filtration that if not regularly maintained
will cause productivity, comfort and health of the occupants to suffer.

### What are the Goals of an HVAC System?

1\. Adjust the room's temperature to keep the occupants comfortable.

2\. Supply fresh exterior air circulation to the room and alleviate CO2 buildup,
so occupants will experience better health and better performance gains in the
workplace.

3\. Provide air filtration using filters at various stages for the recirculated
conditioned air since it can carry contaminants and dust, which can cause
respiratory illness.

4\. Be energy efficient and economical due to the spiraling cost of fuel.

### What facilities is the HVAC System's air filtration feature most critical?

- Clean rooms
- Medical facilities
- Hazardous materials

### HVAC Sensor Data

### Where does the Sensor Data Come From?

The sensor data comes from building operations. There are Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in 20 large buildings around the world.

### What sensors are used in HVAC Systems?

- **Thermostat**: regulates temperature switching between heat or air conditioning.

- **Pressure Sensor**: monitors air flow, heating and cooling.

- **Duct Smoke Detectors**: prevent HVAC systems from spreading smoke through a
building by moving smoke from one area to another area.

- **Indoor Air Quality Sensor**: carbon sensors measure carbon levels in the air
, which is an indicator of air circulation and when poor air circulation is
relevant, the chances of contaminants in the air increases

### Why are the sensors important for HVAC Systems?

The sensors help HVAC Systems run smoothly and safely, improve energy efficiency
and preserve human health.

### HVAC Data Analysis

Through analysis of the HVAC datasets, we can retrieve insight to see which HVAC
System Models are adjusting the temperature in buildings most effectively. We
can also see the country at which these buildings reside. For instance, if you
own a business that has 20 buildings with an HVAC System spread across multiple
countries, the buildings that have extreme temperatures of HOT or COLD may need
to have their HVAC Systems replaced especially the ones that are old. The
visualization of the data would be able to make it easier to locate buildings
from particular countries that have HVAC Systems that need to be replaced.

## Summary

Congratulations! Now you are familiar with the purpose of an HVAC System. You
have an idea of the common sensors that are used in HVAC Systems and how data
from these systems can be analyzed to determine whether a system is in need of
being replaced. With this foundation, you are ready to start building the
application.

## Appendix A: Components that make up an HVAC System

- **Chiller/Air Conditioner**: utilizes heat exchangers or circulated fluid or
gas to cool the air that is passed through it

- **Air Handler**: is a fan or blower that moves air through a general filter
then moves the air throughout the buildings ductwork

- **Air Filters**: consists of various grades of air filters used in the system
depending on the requirements of the occupants and the activities in the
building

- **HEPA**: sophisticated filters used in the downstreamed ductwork

- **Ductwork**: are round and rectangular duct work, which provides a pass for
the conditioned air from the air handling unit to the environment

- **Damper**: consists of one more blades used to control the amount of air flow
through a duct

- **Manual Damper**: ensures different parts of the building receive
proportional ventilation based on area and demand

- **Automated Damper**: are usually installed at firewall which close in the
case of a fire

- **Terminal Unit**: uses an automated damper controls the amount of air which
is delivered to a room or region

- **Electric Pneumatic or Digital Actuator**: is regulated by a thermostat and
controls the automatic damper that is used by the terminal unit

- **Zones**: are a set of regions or rooms in a building, which have a set of
identical heating and air conditioning needs. It is typical practice to assign
one terminal unit and thermostat to each zone

- **Heating Coils**: provide an efficient way of providing heat for those few
areas that require it and are controlled by the same thermostat system as the
terminal unit

- **Linings/Attenuators**: dampen noise within a duct a short length of line
ductwork

- **Grilles, Registers, Diffusers (GRDS)**: is a way for air from the ductwork to enter
the occupied workspace.

- **Return Inlets**: after air enters the occupied workspace, air will circulate
through the return inlets and returns to the air handling unit
